# mimic
Raspberry Pi code for skull to copy movement of IMU sensor. Sensor and skull communicate wirelessly
## Overview
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project has two units, a sensor unit and a controller unit. The sensor unit consists of a Raspberry Pi Zero W and an Adafruit BNO055 9 degree of freedom IMU Board. The controller unit consists of another Pi Zero W and a Pololu Maestro Servo Controller. 
=======
The project has two units: the sensor unit and the controller unit. The Sensor unit consists of a Raspberry Pi Zero W and an Adafruit BNO055 9-Degrees of Freedom IMU board. The controller unit consists of another Pi Zero W and a Pololu Maestro Servo Controller. The two communicate with each other using XMLRPC running over WiFi. The Sensor unit acts as the server and the Controller unit acts as the client. 
## Prerequisites
The sensor software uses CircuitPython and Adafruit's Blinka library must be installed to support CircuitPython on a Pi.
